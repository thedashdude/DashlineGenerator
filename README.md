How To Use
---
Once the program is running you may specify an output folder. This is the folder of the level you wish to overwrite. You may type in the folder, paste it in or drag the folder onto the `EDIT FOLDER` screen to set that as the output folder. If you leave the output folder blank the written files will be placed in the same folder as the program to do with as you see fit.


Hit `space` or click `GENERATE` to build a new level.

Click `CHARACTER` to cycle through the playable characters.

Click `ENEMY` to cycle through the enemies the character can fight.

The bar on the right contains various parameters you can increment and decrement. More can be seen by scrolling.

`SIDEBAR HELP 1` and `SIDEBAR HELP 2` display the information on the parameters.

Hitting `PUBLISH` writes the generated files to the specified folder if possible.
